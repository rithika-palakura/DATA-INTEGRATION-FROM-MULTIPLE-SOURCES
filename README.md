# DESCRIPTION OF TASK
This project focused on integrating data from multiple sources to create a unified report and interactive visualizations using Tableau Cloud. The task, completed as part of an internship with CodTech, involved combining datasets from an Excel file and a simulated SQL Server database (represented by Google Sheets) to build a dynamic dashboard. The aim was to demonstrate the ability to merge and analyze data from diverse sources without relying on local software installations, showcasing the power of cloud-based tools for data integration and visualization. The process began with data preparation. An e-commerce dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in CSV format to serve as the Excel data source. This dataset included fields such as OrderID, Product Category, Ship State, and Sales Amount. To simulate a SQL Server database, another dataset was created and uploaded to Google Sheets. This dataset contained fields like CustomerID, Region, OrderID, and Payment Status, complementing the Excel dataset for integration. These datasets were carefully reviewed to ensure compatibility and consistency. The next step was to connect the data sources to Tableau Cloud. The Excel file was uploaded to Google Drive and connected to Tableau via the file connection option. Similarly, the Google Sheets dataset was linked to Tableau Cloud directly, simulating a SQL Server data connection. In Tableau Cloud’s Data Source tab, both datasets were added to the canvas, and a join operation was performed. The join key used was the common `OrderID` field, ensuring the datasets were seamlessly merged. A join type was selected to include only matching records, preserving the integrity and relevance of the unified dataset.With the data integration complete, visualizations were created to provide insights into the merged dataset. For instance, a bar chart was developed to analyze sales distribution across states, while a pie chart illustrated the proportion of various payment statuses. A line chart visualized sales trends over time, highlighting seasonal patterns and fluctuations. Filters such as Category and Region were added to these visualizations, enabling users to interact with the data and explore specific segments dynamically.
The final step involved assembling these visualizations into an interactive dashboard in Tableau Cloud. The dashboard was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with integrated filters and legends to allow stakeholders to drill down into the data effortlessly. Once completed, the dashboard was tested for accuracy and responsiveness, ensuring it met the project’s objectives. The completed dashboard was published to Tableau Cloud, and a shareable link was generated for stakeholder access.
This project successfully demonstrated the integration of multiple data sources and the creation of actionable visualizations. Using Tableau Cloud ensured a streamlined and efficient process without the need for local software installations. The resulting dashboard provided valuable insights into e-commerce sales and customer behavior, underscoring the potential of data-driven decision-making in a business context. This work highlights the importance of combining data from diverse platforms to uncover meaningful trends and patterns, delivering a comprehensive view of the underlying datasets.
